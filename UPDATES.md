# Kolam AI - Recent Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Image Storage Organization
- Created `backend/generated_images/` folder for all generated images
- Updated `.gitignore` files to exclude generated images from version control
- Moved existing test images to the new folder structure

### 2. API Response Format Update
- Changed API response from `image_base64` to `recreated_input` for better clarity
- Updated frontend to use the new response format

### 3. Pattern Generation Enhancement
- Modified similar design generation to **only produce traditional Kolam patterns**
- Implemented sorting of generated patterns by **similarity percentage in descending order**
- Each generated image is automatically saved to the `generated_images` folder with timestamp

### 4. Dependencies Management
- **Deleted** the old `requirements.txt` file
- **Generated new** `requirements.txt` using `pip list --format=freeze` command
- Updated to include all currently installed packages

### 5. Docker Infrastructure
- **Updated backend Dockerfile** to use Python 3.13.5
- **Created new frontend Dockerfile** with multi-stage build using Node.js and Nginx
- **Created Docker Compose file** for complete application orchestration
- Added proper networking and volume mounts for generated images
- Created Nginx configuration for frontend with API proxy to backend
